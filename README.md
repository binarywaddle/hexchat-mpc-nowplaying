# hexchat-mpc-nowplaying
Python script for Hexchat to show the currently playing media for MPC-HC and variations such as MPC-BE that don't work with the built in plugin as long as they provide a web interface. Typing ``/np`` will show the file name of what you're watching while typing ``/np full`` will show additional info.

Requirements:

* Python 3

Additional requrirements via pip

* BeautifulSoup 4

* requests for Python

* html5lib

Install the above requirements using pip. An example would be open up an administrator command prompt, type ``pip install beautifulsoup4``

I'm not providing any support for this really, I'm just putting this up here for others to benefit from. I use MPC-BE and the built in plugin for Hexchat doesn't work with it so I decided to see what I could do.
