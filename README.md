# hexchat-mpc-nowplaying
Python script for Hexchat to show the currently playing media for MPC-HC and variations such as MPC-BE that don't work with the built in plugin as long as they provide a web interface.

Requirements:

* Python 3

* BeautifulSoup 4

* request for Python


I'm not providing any support for this really, I'm just putting this up here for others to benefit from. I use MPC-BE and the built in plugin for Hexchat doesn't work with it so I decided to see what I could do.
